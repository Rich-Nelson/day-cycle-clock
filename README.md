# day-cycle-clock

This repository contains the mechanical and electrical CAD for the Day Cycle Clock.  The code can be found in this repo https://github.com/Rich-Nelson/day-cycle-clock-code

Links to the build video and blog post coming soon.

## CAD
Contains the mechanical models.  In the root directoy there is a .STEP and .SLDASM of the full assembly

- **STL** Has all of the printable files for the project
- **SLDPRT** Contains the individual component models and sub assemblies
- **SLDDRW** Contaisn the 2-D dimensioned drawings for some of the fabricated components, mainly the wooden enclosure
- **Backlight Bracket** 3 versions of the backlight screen assembly were made depending on which you want to use.
    - **v1** Backlight assembly with through hole 5mm LEDs
    - **v2** Backlight assembly with SMD LEDs on perf board
    - **v3** Backlight assembly with custom PCB (found int he PCB folder)

## PCB
Contains the KiCAD PCB files and Gerbers.

**Note** I may need to update some customer libraries into this repo so that the KiCAD project will load properly on other computers.  But for now the gerbers are available to make your own boards.

## Graphics
Contains the vector outlines used for the 3 cutout layers.
